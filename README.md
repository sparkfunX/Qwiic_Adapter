There are already many I<sup>2</sup>C devices in the wild. The Qwiic adapter converts the standard I2C pinout (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) to the 4-pin 1mm JST connector used in the Qwiic system.

As we develop new I2C products we will be adding the Qwiic connector to them. In the mean time, this adapter allows you to purchase one of these [currently supported boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#existing-boards), solder it on, and get it on the Qwiic system quickly (grin). You can also solder the four wires on any 3.3V I<sup>2</sup>C device to the adapter get it on the Qwiic system.

The [Qwiic system](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) enables fast and solderless connection between popular platforms and various sensors and actuators. You can read more about the Qwiic system [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
